This repository contains a Python project for modeling and predicting tips based on data from the 'tips' dataset in Seaborn, which includes transactions at a restaurant. 
The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning model comparison, polynomial regression, and prediction.
- Project Overview
   Dataset: 'tips' from Seaborn
  
    Objective: Predict the amount of tip given various features like total bill, time of day, etc.
  
    Data Exploration & Visualization: Initial data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
  
    Data Preprocessing:
        Encoding categorical variables using pandas get_dummies().
        Feature scaling using StandardScaler from sklearn.
- Models
    Linear Regression
    Ridge Regression
    Lasso Regression
    Random Forest Regression
    Polynomial Regression
     Cross-validation for model evaluation.
    Model Evaluation:
        Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for evaluating model performance.
    Polynomial Regression: An extended approach to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
    Prediction: Demonstrates how to use the model to predict tips for new observations.
    Visualization: Comparing predictions from different models visually.
    Analysis: Includes a comparison between linear models and a polynomial regression model to assess if non-linear relationships improve predictions.
Future Work
    Explore more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting).
    Perform hyperparameter tuning for each model.
    Investigate feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
    Collect more data or incorporate external datasets to enhance predictions.
