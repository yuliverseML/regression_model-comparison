  # Machine Learning Model Comparison for Tips Prediction

This repository contains a Python project for modeling and predicting tips based on data from the 'tips' dataset in Seaborn, which includes transactions at a restaurant. 
The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning model comparison, polynomial regression, and prediction.

- Objective: Demonstrate the effectiveness of selected models and comparison methods within the chosen dataset for the ML project.


## Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Polynomial Regression**

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Basic statistics and information about the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding and scaling features.
- **Model Training:** Training multiple models with cross-validation.
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparison using  Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), Cross-validation R² (mean and standard deviation) scores.
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots for actual vs. predicted tips, bar plots for metric comparison, and feature importance for the model with an added feature.
- **Polynomial Regression:** An extension to see if polynomial features improve prediction.
- **New Feature Addition:** Introduction of a random new feature to check impact on model performance.

## Results

- **Model Comparison:** The trained models are compared visually using scatter plots of the actual vs. predicted  values. The best model is selected based on the highest R² score and lowest MSE.
Barplots are used to compare the R² and MSE metrics for all models side by side.
- **Best Model:** Identifies the best model and provides a prediction for a random bill amount.
- **Feature Importance:** After adding a new feature, it shows how this impacts the model's performance and feature importance.

## Outcome

- **Best Performing Model:** The Ridge Regression showed superior performance in terms of both MSE and R2 scores (MSE 0.7023, R² 0.4381).
- **Impact of New Feature:** Adding a random feature slightly improved the model's R2 score but increased the MSE, suggesting potential overfitting or noise introduction.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Did not significantly outperform the best linear model, indicating that the relationship might not benefit from higher-degree polynomial features in this context.

## Future Work

  Explore more advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting).
    
  Perform hyperparameter tuning for each model.
    
  Investigate feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
    
  Collect more data or incorporate external datasets to enhance predictions.

## Notes
 When considering datasets for a  similar task , here are different types of datasets:

- Suitable Datasets:

1. Service Industry Data:
   - Restaurant Transactions 

2. Customer Feedback and Service Data:
   - Hotel Check-ins or Room Service 

3. Sales Data with Gratuity:
   - Bar or Cafe Transactions 

- Potentially Suitable Datasets:

1. General Retail Transactions:
 
2. Event or Entertainment Industry:

- Not Suitable Datasets:

1. Non-Service Financial Transactions:
   - Bank Transactions or Stock Market Data

2. Healthcare Data
 
3. Manufacturing or Production Data

4. Scientific Research Data
(Lack of relevant features, different behavioral dynamics, absence of direct interaction, privacy and ethical concerns)
